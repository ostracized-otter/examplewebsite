            <a>This site is a showcase of some digital tech assesments that I have worked on, and also some cool stuff that I put in for fun. This text is in english, which is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family originating on the island of Great Britain. As you read this text, you may wonder if it is going to rain. When an apple is cut (or bruised), oxygen is introduced into the injured plant tissue. When oxygen is present in cells, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzymes in the chloroplasts rapidly oxidize phenolic compounds naturally present in the apple tissues to o-quinones, colorless precursors to brown-colored secondary products.</a>
