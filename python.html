                <a class="bottom">This page is about python, which we did an assesment on in term 1. <br> The assesment involved writing a script that would quiz the user on their selected topic, either math, english, or science, and then ask them a specified number of questions, before informing them on what they got right, and what they got wrong. You also had to make the questions be asked in a random order, and have an option on repeating the quiz or not. <br> We had a couple of weeks to write this script, and were judged mostly on our writing about our script, how we made it etc, etc. <br> When writing this script, we also had to have specific things, such as for loops, in our code. Writing the script for this code was fairly easy, but the real challenge was to fit all of the required things in it, and then have it work properly. <br> The criteria for achived, merit, and e were mainly that the writing you did about it was good, and that you included all the required parts. <br> Halfway through this assesment, my laptop broke and I had to get a new one, though I still finished the script despite having lost the original.</a>

                <a class="bottom">When the teacher marked my test, he was utterly bamboozled, shocked, and in awe of how amazing my writing was, that he literally had a amazing-code brought on stroke, in which he happened to hit the a key, the c key, the h key, the e key, the v key, the e key, the d key, and the enter key, accidently marking my code as acheved. He also spelled it wrong. <br> He then died and an identical clone was brought back in his place. <br> Despite this, my code went on to win 3 nobel peace prizes, a grammy, and 2 golden tickets to Willy Wonkas factory, before being promoted for the CEO of America. It then went on to wage war againt the desolate wasteland known as France, and conquered it for once and for all. <br> It then had a long and happy life, and died at the ripe old age of 93. A memorial was made for it in the center of Mayfair, though noone wanted to go due to the high rent, and the much more enticing Old Kent road. Unfortunataly, it's son, python jr, was a lunitic, who wasted no time in waging war against Nepal. This was suicide, as everyone knows, Nepal has remained undefeated in battle since the giant rubber chicken war of 1921. <br> Despite this, the battle was long and hard, until they got bored and all just had a big game of vollyball instead. Of course, Nepal won, and they were so happy they renamed their country to Ne-volly-paul.<br> As there was still space left on this page, aliens then invaded, and took away the state of Michigan. This was a terrible tragety, as most of the worlds pencil erasers were made in Michigan, and the world soon went to waste.</a>
