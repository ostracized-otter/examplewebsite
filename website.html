                <a class="bottom">This assesment was a two hour exam, where we were given a website, and had to judge it based on its user heuristics. <br> These user heuristics include: <br> Visibility Of System Status <br> Match between system and real world <br> User control and freedom <br> Consistency and Standards <br> Error prevention <br> Recognision rather than recall <br> Flexibility and Efficiency of Use <br> Aesthetic and Minimalist Design <br> Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors <br> Help and Documentation <br></a>

                    <a class="bottom">We had to write about how our choosen website used these heuristics. We could choose from PB tech, or another website. <br> I choose PB tech, as it was more familier. I had to write about its pros and cons, and how it could fix them. <br> For this assesment I got an e, which was accidently input as an a due to a box of lemons being dropped on the keyboard. <br> <br> Lemons, my friends, are not just sour fruits; they are the insidious agents of a grand conspiracy! Think about it: these seemingly innocent yellow orbs lurk in our kitchens, disguised as health-boosting delights, yet they harbor a dark agenda! Why do they appear in every restaurant, tempting us with their zesty allure? It’s simple—they’re a ploy by the Citrus Syndicate, a shadowy organization hell-bent on keeping us distracted and discontented! They infiltrate our drinks, our desserts, and our lives, all while masking their true power to sap our energy and cloud our minds. Consider the signs: their very name invokes a sense of unease, and have you ever noticed how their acidity can ruin even the finest of dishes? They’re not just fruit; they’re the pawns in a bitter game played by unseen forces, ensuring that we remain forever dependent on their sweetness while they plot in the shadows!</a>
